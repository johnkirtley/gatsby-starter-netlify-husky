Originally bred for sledding in the colder climates of Siberia, these dogs have a thick double coat to protect them from the cold and are well-suited for living in colder environments.

## High Energy

In terms of behavior, Siberian Huskies are generally very active and energetic dogs. They have a high exercise requirement and need plenty of opportunities to run and play to stay happy and healthy. They are also known to be very intelligent and can learn quickly, but they can also be stubborn and may require patience and consistency when it comes to training.

## They Like To Speak

One of the most characteristic behaviors of Siberian Huskies is their vocalization. They are known to be vocal dogs and will often howl, whine, or make other noises to communicate. This can be a source of entertainment for their owners, but it can also be a nuisance if the dog is left alone for long periods of time and becomes bored or anxious.

## Huskies and Smaller Animals

Another trait of Siberian Huskies is their strong prey drive. As a result, they may be prone to chasing after small animals, including birds and rodents. This can be a problem if the dog is not well-supervised or if they are not adequately trained to resist this instinct.

## Party Animals

Siberian Huskies are also known to be social animals and thrive on being part of a family. They are typically good with children and get along well with other dogs, but they may be reserved or aloof around strangers.

## You Won't Regret It...I Hope :)

Overall, Siberian Huskies are energetic, intelligent, and vocal dogs that thrive on being part of a family. They have a high exercise requirement and need plenty of opportunities to run and play. They are also known to be stubborn and may require patience and consistency when it comes to training. With the right training and socialization, they can make loyal and loving pets.
