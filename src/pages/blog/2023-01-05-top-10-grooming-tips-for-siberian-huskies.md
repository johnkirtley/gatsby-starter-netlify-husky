## 1. Brush your husky regularly

Huskies shed a lot, and their shedding increases during the spring and fall when they are shedding their winter coat. It's important to brush your husky at least once a week to remove loose hair and prevent matting. Use a slicker brush or a comb with wide teeth to gently comb through their coat.

## 2. Bathe your husky as needed

Huskies don't need to be bathed often, as their coat is naturally water-resistant. You can bathe your husky every few months or as needed if they get dirty or smell bad. Use a mild puppy shampoo and make sure to rinse thoroughly to remove all the soap from their coat.

## 3. Trim your husky's nails

It's important to keep your husky's nails trimmed to prevent them from getting too long and causing discomfort or problems walking. You can use a nail clipper or a grinder to trim their nails. Be careful not to cut too close to the quick, as this can cause bleeding and pain.

## 4. Clean your husky's ears

Huskies are prone to ear infections, so it's important to check and clean their ears regularly. Use a cotton ball or pad to gently clean the inside of their ears, being careful not to insert anything into the ear canal.

## 5. Brush your husky's teeth

Like all dogs, huskies need their teeth brushed to prevent dental problems. Use a toothbrush and toothpaste made specifically for dogs, and brush their teeth at least once a week.

## 6. Check your husky's eyes

Huskies are prone to eye problems, so it's important to check their eyes regularly and keep them clean. Use a damp cloth to gently wipe away any dirt or discharge.

## 7. Keep your husky's coat healthy

To keep your husky's coat healthy, feed them a high-quality diet and give them plenty of water. You can also use a conditioner or coat oil to help keep their coat soft and shiny.

## 8. Trim your husky's coat

If your husky's coat is getting too long, you can have it trimmed by a professional groomer or do it yourself with a pair of thinning shears. Be careful not to cut too much, as it's important to maintain the integrity of their coat.

## 9. Remove tangles and mats

If you find tangles or mats in your husky's coat, use a comb or a mat splitter to gently remove them. Don't try to pull them out, as this can cause pain and damage to your husky's coat.

## 10. Give your husky plenty of exercise

Grooming your husky is not just about maintaining their appearance. It's also about keeping them healthy and happy. Make sure to give your husky plenty of exercise and playtime to help keep them in good physical and mental shape.
