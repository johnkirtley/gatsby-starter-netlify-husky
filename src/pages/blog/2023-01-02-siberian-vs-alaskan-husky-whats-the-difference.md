One of the main differences between Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Huskies is their size and appearance. Siberian Huskies are typically larger and heavier than Alaskan Huskies, with a thicker double coat to protect them from the cold. They also tend to have a more striking appearance, with a more defined "wolf-like" appearance due to their thicker fur and facial markings.

## Attitude

In terms of temperament, Siberian Huskies are known to be more outgoing and friendly, while Alaskan Huskies are generally more independent and aloof. Siberian Huskies are also more vocal and prone to howling, while Alaskan Huskies are generally quieter.

## Difference In Why They Were Bred

Another difference between the two breeds is their primary function. Siberian Huskies were originally bred for sledding and as working dogs in colder climates, while Alaskan Huskies were developed specifically for racing. As a result, Alaskan Huskies are generally faster and more athletic than Siberian Huskies, with a leaner build and a single coat to reduce drag.

## Same, But Different

Overall, while Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Huskies may have some similarities due to their shared sledding history, they are distinct breeds with their own unique characteristics. Siberian Huskies are larger, more outgoing, and have a thicker double coat, while Alaskan Huskies are smaller, more independent, and have a leaner build.
