## You're The Leader

First and foremost, it is important to establish yourself as the leader of the pack. Huskies are pack animals and they need a strong, confident leader to follow. In order to establish your leadership, you should make sure you are the one who controls the resources, such as food, toys, and attention. You should also set clear rules and boundaries for your husky to follow, and consistently enforce them.

## Train ASAP

Training should begin as early as possible, ideally when your husky is still a puppy. Puppies are more receptive to learning and are more open to new experiences, so it is easier to teach them good habits from the start. Start with basic obedience training, such as teaching your husky to sit, stay, and come when called. Use positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats and praise, to encourage your husky to follow your commands.

## Let Them Socialize

It is also important to socialize your husky as early as possible. This means exposing them to a variety of people, places, and situations so that they become comfortable and confident in a variety of environments. This will help prevent fearfulness and aggression as your husky grows older.

## Keep Them Busy

Huskies are intelligent and energetic, so it is important to provide them with plenty of mental and physical stimulation. This can include training sessions, interactive toys, and activities such as running, playing fetch, or agility courses. These activities can help keep your husky's mind and body active and can also help prevent boredom and destructive behavior.

## In Summary

Training and obedience take time, patience, and consistency. It is important to be consistent in your expectations and in the way you reward or correct your husky's behavior. With the right approach and commitment, you can teach your husky to be a well-behaved and obedient companion.
