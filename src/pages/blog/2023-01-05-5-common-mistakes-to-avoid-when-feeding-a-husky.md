1. ## Not providing enough food:

   Huskies have high energy needs due to their active nature, and they require a diet that is rich in protein and fat to fuel their bodies. Skimping on food can lead to weight loss, muscle wasting, and other health problems. Make sure to feed your husky a high-quality diet that meets their nutritional needs.

2. ## Overfeeding:

   On the other hand, it's also possible to overfeed your husky, which can lead to obesity and other health problems. To avoid this, measure out your husky's food carefully and stick to the recommended serving sizes. Keep in mind that treats and table scraps should be given in moderation, as they can contribute to excess weight gain.

   It's important to pay attention to portion size, but we also [use a speed feeder bowl](https://amzn.to/3Z7efpH) so they don't eat too fast.

3. ## Feeding the wrong type of food:

   Not all dog food is created equal, and it's important to choose a high-quality diet that meets your husky's nutritional needs. Avoid cheap, low-quality brands that are filled with fillers and by-products, and opt for a diet that is made with whole, nutrient-rich ingredients.
4. ## Not providing enough water:

   Water is essential for your husky's health, and it's important to make sure they have access to clean, fresh water at all times. Dehydration can lead to serious health problems, so make sure to refill your husky's water bowl regularly and encourage them to drink.

   Our husky goes through tons of water. We prefer a larger bowl so we aren't constantly refilling: [Noa Store Automatic Pet Water Dispenser](https://amzn.to/3ilQyJr)
5. ## Feeding your husky a diet that is not appropriate for their life stage:

   Just like humans, dogs have different nutritional needs at different stages of life. Puppies, for example, require a diet that is higher in protein and fat to support their rapid growth and development, while adult dogs and seniors have different needs. Make sure to choose a diet that is appropriate for your husky's age and lifestyle.

   ## Summary

By avoiding these common mistakes and providing your husky with a well-balanced diet, you can help them maintain optimal health and happiness.
