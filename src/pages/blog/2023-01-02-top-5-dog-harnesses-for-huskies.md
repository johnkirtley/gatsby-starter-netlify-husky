## Things To Look Out For

Some potential drawbacks to consider when using any dog harness include (not aimed at any particular model or brand):

* **Size**: It's important to measure your dog and select the correct size of harness to ensure a good fit. If the harness is too small, it may be too tight and uncomfortable for your dog. If it is too large, it may be too loose and may not provide enough support or control.
* **Comfort**: Some dogs may not be comfortable wearing a harness, especially if they are not used to it. It's important to gradually introduce your dog to the harness and give them time to get used to it before using it for extended periods of time.
* **Durability**: As with any product, there is a possibility that the harness could break or wear out over time. It's important to check the harness regularly for any signs of damage and replace it if necessary.
* **Restriction of movement**: While a harness can help prevent your dog from pulling or lunging, it may also restrict their natural movement to some degree. It's important to consider this and make sure your dog is comfortable and able to move freely when wearing the harness.

Again, these are just some potential cons to consider when using a dog harness. It's always a good idea to carefully evaluate the product and consider your dog's specific needs and comfort before making a decision.

## In Summary

Overall, these are some of the top dog harnesses for huskies that are popular among pet owners. It's important to carefully consider your dog's specific needs and comfort when selecting a harness, and to make sure it fits properly for maximum effectiveness.
